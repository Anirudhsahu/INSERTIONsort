# INSERTIONsort

This repository contains an implementation of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm, a simple and efficient sorting algorithm for small datasets. The repository includes code and additional resources to help you understand how the algorithm works.

## Features

- **Insertion Sort Algorithm**: Sorts an array of numbers using the Insertion Sort method.
- **User Interface**: A minimalistic user interface is provided for visualizing the sorting process.
- **Code Quality**: Written in **Java** and **Kotlin**.

## Files and Folders

- **app/**: Contains the main application code.
- **.idea/**: Configuration files for the project.
- **gradle/**: Files related to the Gradle build system.
- **insertionsortapp.zip**: A zipped version of the project.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java** 8 or higher
- **Gradle** for building the project

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anirudhsahu/INSERTIONsort.git
   cd INSERTIONsort
Build the project:

bash
Copy code
gradle build
Run the project:

bash
Copy code
gradle run
Example
To demonstrate the sorting process, you can modify the input data in the main program and observe how Insertion Sort processes the array step by step.
